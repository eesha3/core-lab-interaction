<p> 
	My name is Eesha Agrawal. I was born and brought up in Mumbai, India and I came to New York as a student. <br>
	I'm currently a sophomore and I'm majoring in Communication Design. <br>
	I'm also pursuing a minor in Creative Entrepreneurship. <br>
	I absolutely love motion graphics, advertising and marketing and hope to pursue that in my future. <br>
	I previously interned at an entertainment marketing agency called 'Think Jam' in London and really enjoyed it. <br>
	Some of my hobbies are scuba diving, playing the piano, listening to music, travelling and doing anything adventurous. <br>
	I'm also a certified advanced open water diver and in my holidays and breaks try to go diving as much as I can.

<p> I hope to learn a lot more about coding and web design from this class and aim to implement it in my other work. I also want to make my own portfolio website more successful and interactive and hope this class can help me do that. </p>
