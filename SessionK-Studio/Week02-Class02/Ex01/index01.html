<p>Its walls would be cupboards, in light-coloured wood, with fittings of gleaming brass. Three prints, depicting, respectively, 
<ol>
<li>the Derby winner Thunderbird,</li> 
<li>a paddle-steamer named Ville-de-Motitereau,</li>
<li>and a Stephenson locomotive,</li>
</ol>
would lead to a leather curtain hanging on <strong>thick</strong>, black, grainy wooden rings which would <br>
<em>slide</em> <br>
back at the merest touch. <br>
There, the carpet would give way to an almost yellow woodblock floor, partly covered by three faded rugs.<br>

<p>It would be a living room about 
<h3>twenty-three <br><br><br><br>
feet <br><br><br><br>
long </h3>

by <br>

<h3>ten feet wide. </h3><br>
On the left, in a kind of recess, there would be a <strong>large</strong> sofa upholstered in worn black leather, with pale cherrywood bookcases on either side, heaped with books in untidy piles. Above the sofa, a mariner's chart would fill the whole length of that section of the wall. On the other side of a small low table, and beneath a silk prayer-mat nailed to the wall with three large-headed brass studs, matching the leather curtain, <br>
there <br>
would <br>
be <br>
another <br>
sofa, at right angles to the first, with a light-brown velvet covering; it would lead on to a small and spindly piece of furniture, lacquered in dark red and providing three display shelves for knick-knacks: agates and stone eggs, snuffboxes, candy-boxes, jade ashtrays, a mother-of-pearl oystershell, a silver fob watch, a cut-glass glass, a crystal pyramid, a miniature in an oval frame. 
<h3>Further on, </h3>
beyond a padded door, there would be shelving on both sides of the corner, for caskets and for records, beside a closed gramophone of which only four machined-steel knobs would be visible, and above it, a print depicting The Great Parade of the Military Tattoo. <br><br>

Through the window, draped with white and brown curtains in cloth imitating Jouy wallpaper, you would glimpse a few trees, a tiny park, a bit of street. A roll-top desk littered with papers and pen-holders would go with a small cane-seated chair. On a console table would be <br><br>
a telephone, <br>
a leather diary, <br>
a writing pad. <br><br>

Then, on the other side of another door, beyond a low, square revolving bookcase supporting a large, cylindrical vase decorated in blue and filled with yellow roses, set beneath an oblong mirror in a mahogany frame, there would be a narrow table with its two benches upholstered in tartan, which would bring your eye back to the leather curtain.<br><br>

It would be all in browns, ochres, duns and yellows: a world of slightly dull colours, in carefully graded shades, calculated with almost too much artistry, in the midst of which would be some striking, brighter splashes - a cushion in almost garish orange, a few multicoloured book jackets amongst the leather-bound volumes. <br><br>

During the day, the light flooding in would make this room seem a little sad, despite the roses. It would be an evening room. But in the winter, with the curtains drawn, some spots illuminated - 
<ul>
<li>the bookcase corner,</li> 
<li>the record shelves,</li> 
<li>the desk,</li> 
<li>the low table between the two settees,</li> 
<li>and the vague reflections in the mirror</li> 
— and large expanses in shadow, whence all the things would gleam 
<li>the polished wood,</li> 
<li>the rich,</li> 
<li>heavy silks,</li> 
<li>the cut glass,</li> 
<li>the softened leather — </li><ul>

<h2>it would be a haven of peace, a land of happiness.</h2>
